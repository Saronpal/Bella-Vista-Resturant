# 🇮🇹 Bella Vista Restaurant Website

## Project Overview

**Bella Vista** is a professional, responsive static website template designed for an authentic Italian restaurant. The design emphasizes a clean, elegant aesthetic with a focus on ease of navigation, a clear menu presentation, and a prominent reservation form.

This project uses standard HTML5 and CSS3, demonstrating strong principles of modern web design, including CSS variables, custom animations, and responsive layouts via media queries.
